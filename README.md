# Musical_Showdown

Musical Showdown is a current work in progres (going very slow because I do not have a lot of spare time). 

## What The App Does:
Musical Showdown is being created to help musicians practice their ear training. The app creates a random melody "n" notes (user chooses note number) based on a wide variety of scales and returns a playable midi file. Then the users goal is to listen to the melody created and play it back on their own instrument which is all picked up from the computer microphone. Once the user plays their melody, the app processes the notes it played versus the notes created in the random melody file and tells them if they were correct. 

You do not need to have pitch perfect ears to use this!!! The app does its mesurements based on the tonal difference between the notes played. Meaning for example if the random melody midi file is in the key of G, you can play your version of the melody in the key of A no problem!
